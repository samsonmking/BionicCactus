### Installation
1. Install [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html)
2. Build and Upload
```bash
platformio run --target upload
```
To run in simulation mode with only the ESP8266 (no PCB connected) change Settings.hpp
```c++
#define SIMULATED false
```
to
```c++
#define SIMULATED true
```
3. See [wiki](https://github.com/samsonmking/BionicCactus/wiki) for setup and configuration
